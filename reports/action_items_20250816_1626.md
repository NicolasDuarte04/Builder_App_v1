## Coverage gaps (threshold < 6)
- auto: 1 plans → add 5+
- hogar: 3 plans → add 3+

## Data quality
- 0 plans with null price; 0 with zero price
- 0 plans missing external_link; 70 missing brochure_link
- 0 plans with empty benefits; 9 with empty tags

## Prioritization suggestions
- Boost categories with lowest counts first (e.g., auto, hogar, otros if under threshold).
- Focus on top providers for those categories (from coverage.md top list).
- Ensure external_link present and benefits populated for all newly added plans.
